## Bob Swetz - Online Business Consultant

Home Business Online w/ Bob Swetz was started by Bob Swetz.

He's been in business for himself for well over 15 years! Starting out as an accountant and owning his own CPA, Bob decided he no longer wanted to crunch numbers. So, he closed his CPA firm and moved in to the world of I.T. and started making software products. Though satisfying, making software didn't give Bob the feeling he was looking for. Bob wanted to help people. Yes! People use software all the time. But that wasn't the help Bob wanted give. He wanted to give a more, person-to-person kind of help.

Bob noticed all of the people starting businesses and how much trouble they were having. He knew the hardships of being a business owner because he was one, himself. Though Bob's business didn't fail, it still wasn't easy getting to where it was. It took hard work and dedication. He knew just what to do!
